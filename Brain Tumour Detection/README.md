# DL_brain_tumour_detection

Project description:

Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patients life therefore.Our project aims to help medical practitioners speed up the classification of MRI scans for brain tumors.

(unfortunately for AlexNet and CNN , we had difficulties moving it to one drive due to its large size - 12GB and 42 gB , thus it could only be accessed from the gpu cluster where we trained it - however if unable to access GPU cluster , the tester codes to prove reproducibility has been run already , we are sorry for that!)
