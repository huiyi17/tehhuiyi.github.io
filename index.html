								<p>Hi, I am Hui Yi. I am currently a Year 2 undergraduate studying computer science in Singapore University of Technology and Design. As I want to be a data scientist, I would like to leverage my expertise in statistics, programming, and machine learning to extract insights from complex data sets, solve real world problems and drive data-informed decision-making in diverse domains. Besides, being the Vice President of the badminton club in 2022, representing my university in the Singapore University Games 2021-2022 in floorball and achieving 2nd position, and being the SUTD representative of the badminton club for Singapore University Games 2022, are good experiences for me to improve my skills such as leadership and teamwork. I had also joined the National AI Student Challenge 2022 and my team has been selected as one of the grand finalists.</p>

								<h3 class="major">ST Engineering Electronics Ltd. (May 2022 - Sep 2022)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/stengineering.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this job, I worked as a temporary data analyst. I processed data that my superior needs using Microsoft Excel formula and Python programming language. In addition, I performed data visualization using pivot chart in Microsoft Excel and SAS Visual Analytics. I also created a UAT template and performed testing for GoParkin mobile application and assisted my superiors in video editing. </p>
								<h3 class="major">ST Engineering Electronics Ltd. (Mar 2021 - Jul 2021)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/testimonial.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In this job, I worked as an associate engineer. I handled a ST Engineering-SPF (Singapore Police Force) project in network equipment configuration for the renewal of CA certificates of routers and switches configuration on site. (HDB) I had learnt about project management. It is important to make sure that time management, scope management and resources management are in balance. I planned and coordinated with the authority on the daily deployment schedule. I also performed forecasting on the completion date of the project and managed to deploy over 1,400 routers with around one month earlier than the expected date. After I have more experience on it, I led three interns and assisted my superior in another project, which is also network equipment configuration on MRT sites.</p>
								<h3 class="major">SAS Pte. Ltd. (Sep 2020 - Jan 2021)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/terrarium.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Through this internship, I had enhanced my Microsoft Excel skill and learnt that having a good communication is very important in the workplace. Besides, I was also given the opportunity to enrol in their courses such as SAS Programming, SAS Visual Analytics and Statistics. After passing their SAS Base Programming examination, I was awarded a SAS Certified Specialist_Base Programming Using SAS 9.4 certificate. Before ending my internship, I was invited to my supervisor's house to have an experience on making a rainbow-theme terrarium. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<h3 class="major">Chop2Pay (Jan 2023 - Feb 2023)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aichallenge.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Together with Vinny, Jamie and Le Ying as a team, we managed to get into grand final in the National AI Student Challenge 2022 with this project. Chop2pay is a Kivy application utilising Peeking Duck and YOLO object detection model to identify the products that customers place at checkouts. Thus, customer don't need to individually scan their products' barcodes. Chop2pay will automatically detect the products on the conveyor belt using a strategically-placed camera, and ring up those products within seconds.</p>

								<p>Click <a href="https://huiyi17.github.io/tehhuiyi.github.io/">here</a> to take a look on this project!</p>
								<p>In this project, we leveraged Python to observe the relationship between crop price and quantity of pesticide and herbicide used by performing data visualization. We also performed predictive analysis by building model, evaluating model with metric such as adjusted r^2 and improving the linear regression model using Machine Learning. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Kindred United (Apr 2020 - Aug 2020)</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/kindred.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The purpose of this project is to promote the building of positive relationships and stronger bonds among families by leveraging technology such as Node-RED and Arduino to detect family members’ emotion, face recognition for account’s login purpose. Mobile application and web application are also developed for features such as gamification, important event and journal’s recording, activity suggestion as well as family’s goal setting.</p>
